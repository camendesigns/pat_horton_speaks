                        <p>Letter sent January 17, 2012 stating Commissioner Patricia Horton voting decision on the Hedgewood
                            Marsh Firing Range which was found to be home to some bald eagles, and blue herring birds.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "As a Commissioner of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, I am a steward
                            of the District's Public land. I believe that we, as elected officials, have a fiduciary responsibility
                            to the citizens of Cook County and neighboring suburbs to preserve and protect our environment.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Already, we are experiencing climate change, acid rain, contamination in our ground water, and children
                            born with toxins in their systems.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Supreme Master Ching Hai, a world renown humanitarian, vegan, worker for world peace and saving
                            the planet believes that we should all be like her and save our environment. We must remain conscious
                            of the choices that we are making because we as humans are destroying our planet.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our choices that we make pertaining to wild life and the environment are setting a pattern for future
                            generations. The Chicago land area offers some of the most diverse flora and fauna found on the planet.
                            This ecosystem is a fragile one, and we have to say enough is enough!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, after careful and considerable deliberation I voted no on the resolution to build an
                            outdoor firing range located at valuable wetlands on the Southeast side of Chicago. This area was
                            recently designated a Millennium Reserve: Calumet Core and it is the mission of the Metropolitan
                            Water Reclamation District of the Greater Chicago to protect and preserve the land that it owns."

                            years of service to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, dated November 15, 2012.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            "...Whereas, having witnessed firsthand the importance of access to clean water on a business trip
                            to Bangladesh, Commissioner Horton studies emerging issues in clean water development and dedicated
                            to commit further to the cause by running for Commissioner of the District in 2006; and
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whereas, as a Commissioner, Patricia pursued her passions for clean water while serving as
                            Chairwoman of the Industrial Waster and Water Pollution Committee and Chairwoman of the Public
                            Health and Welfare Committee; and
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whereas, seeking to best serve the interest of the taxpayer, Commissioner Horton also served as
                            Chairwoman of the Information Technology Committee, Vice-Chair of the Affirmative Action Committee
                            and Vice-Chair of the State Legislation and Rules Committee; and
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whereas, always eager to educate the public about the District's mission to protect our water environment,
                            Commissioner Horton frequently attended public meetings and spoke with community groups about the
                            District's history and accomplishments in the field of waste-water treatment; and
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whereas, other various organizations have benefited from Commissioner Horton's vast knowledge and generous
                            dedication of her time through her service on their executive boards, including but not limited
                            to the Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, the Madison Western Chamber of Commerce
                            in Chicago, The State of Illinois Diabetes Commission, the West Side Women's Business Center, and

                            Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, on behalf of ourselves and staff, do hereby recognize Patricia
                            Horton's dedicated service for six years to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and express our
