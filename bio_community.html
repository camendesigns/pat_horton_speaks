                            the information that is critical in saving lives is disseminated to the people. There are many
                            individuals diagnosed with diabetes and are without health insurance that are in need of this
                            information. As a mother whose daughter was diagnosed with diabetes when she was only four years
                            old, I understand the importance of becoming informed about diet and exercise to help with diabetes.
                            As a diabetic myself, I understand the needs of those who have been diagnosed with this disease in
                            understanding the things that they can implement in their lives to improve their health.

                            process.</p>

                            and understand the demand and focus of excelling in this sport. It has been my life-long experiences
                            playing tennis that I understand the benefits that our children and youth can gain.

                            My goal for wanting to help the kids to learn how to play tennis, is to establish a good healthy
                            regime that they can take throughout their lives. This safe haven assist the urban children in

                            Our motto is, “It’s all about the kids!”. Currently we have around 150 kids from ages 8 to 18
                            receiving free tennis lessons. We have found that the service we offer these children has assisted
                            them in their focus academically. Many of those who have gone through our free tennis lesson
                            service have been able to obtain employment and college degrees.</p>
